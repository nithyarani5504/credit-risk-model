# Interpretable Credit Risk Modeling using Machine Learning, SHAP & LIME

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end, interpretable credit risk
prediction system using machine learning, with SHAP and LIME for
transparent model explanations.

## 🎯 Objective

-   Predict customer credit risk (high/low)
-   Provide explainability using SHAP and LIME
-   Support transparent financial decision-making

## 📊 Dataset

Stored in `data/raw/credit_risk_dataset.csv`.

Features include: - Income\
- Age\
- Loan Amount\
- Loan Purpose\
- Credit Score\
- Employment Status\
- Existing Debts\
- Target: Loan Status (0=Low Risk, 1=High Risk)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   Python, Pandas, NumPy\
-   Scikit-learn, XGBoost\
